# Snarky--The-Voice-Assistant
# Snarky Voice Assistant 🎤  
Because boring assistants are everywhere, and we wanted one with attitude.

## 🤖 What is this?
A voice assistant that doesn’t just answer—it talks back. Expect sarcasm, sass, and zero sugarcoating. If you wanted polite, you should’ve asked Siri.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python (because what else?)
- Streamlit / Jupyter (depends on how lazy you are)
- SpeechRecognition
- pyttsx3 (text-to-speech, aka the snark delivery system)
- Whatever else you feel like installing when it breaks
